In this task, I explored Google Developers Product, TensorFlow. TensorFlow is one of Machine Learning Libraries. In this part I use, Keras that were developed under TensorFlow Libraries. The dataset itself is provided by Dicoding, It's about Rock-Paper-Scissors. I train the data to be able to distinguish those 3 things.

# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source library from Google that mainly used to create machine learning models. TensorFlow is used in many fields. You can use TensorFlow on the website, on mobile devices (by TensorFlow lite), and many more. Most Google products use TensorFlow for machine learning purposes. Technically speaking, TensorFlow is used for image and text classification, language translation, regression, etc.

âœ… Advantages:
- Open-source.
- GPU and TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) support. The model can be trained using GPU or TPU than just using CPU.
- The performance of the model can be visualized by using TensorBoard.
